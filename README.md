# Linear-reg-study
Studying the effect of fitting a linear regression model on insufficient data.

#Model
This linear regression model was built to predict body weights from brain weights, however, the main goal in mind was to see how a linear regression model would generalize on testing data if trained on only a single feature. 

#Results
The model had good performance on training data, but, as expected, didn't generalize near enough on testing data.
